        <h3 id="month-7-was-about-moving-the-kinté-space-blog-into-an-11ty-pipeline">month-7 was about moving the kinté space Blog into an 11ty pipeline</h3>
        <p><em>11ty pipeline for kintespace.com Blog.</em> I am almost certain that end-of-month-8 or early month 9 will see the re-launch of the kintespace.com Blog <em>without</em> WordPress! Success here will make <em>the rasx() context</em> a standalone Songhay Publication on an 11ty production pipeline. This implies that I finally see the way to use 11ty to write to a sibling folder or a folder of another parent—this means every presentation/publication can have its own repo👍 This implies I can make <em>some</em> presentations/publications public on GitHub and use them as a guide for any sophisticated, 3<sup>rd</sup>-party contributors in future💪💡</p>
        <h3 id="month-8-is-about-ssd-andor-motherboard-failure-and-daz3d-apphangtransient-errors">month-8 is about SSD and/or motherboard failure and Daz3D AppHangTransient errors</h3>
        <p><em>SSD and/or motherboard failure.</em> My internal hardware journal is packed full of a miserable adventure that all started with me falsely accusing myself of letting studio hardware age over five years. It turns out that the eldest piece, a Western Digital Black (Scorpio?) 320 GB 2.5&quot; drive from 2011, did <em>not</em> fail. Either my Samsung EVO SSD from 2017 dropped into a read-only-mode coma or my Asus M5A97 motherboard from 2015 independently decided there was no operating system volume. This drama left me with a few takeaways:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>consider <a href="https://www.howto-connect.com/tweak-paging-file-for-better-windows-10-performance/">customizing the Windows 10 paging-file strategy</a> to encourage the OS to beat up a mechanical drive with a huge paging-file allocation</li>
            <li>MSI motherboard RAM slots ship with LEDs that glow <em>red</em> when everything is apparently fine</li>
            <li>consider adding calendar events for studio-hardware, five-year birthdays</li>
        </ul>
        <p><em>Daz3D AppHangTransient errors.</em> After serious suffering with the hardware woes above, I was very much looking forward to seeing Daz3D Studio 4.11.x running on this new hardware. Nope. 😶 Here are/were the suspicious issues that could be preventing Daz from running:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>the PostgreSQL CMS is not starting</li>
            <li><del>the Radeon Virtual Super Resolution settings being on</del></li>
            <li><del>the default paging file is too small for Daz3D (on the new system)</del></li>
            <li>my old-ass Radeon R9 270X is not really working properly on the new MSI AMD X470 motherboard</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Until this issue is resolved, I can fall back to my Sager laptop (and an HDMI cable) to work with Daz3D there.😬😒</p>
        <h3 id="sketching-out-a-development-schedule-revision-2">sketching out a development schedule (revision 2)</h3>
        <p>Today the studio development schedule looks like this:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><del>get 11ty pipelines running with the FunkyKB</del> ✔</li>
            <li><del>migrate Thunderbird email to new Hyper-V Ubuntu VM</del> ✔</li>
            <li>move the kinté space blog to an 11ty pipeline (this has been another emergency <em>for years</em>) 🔥🚜🔨</li>
            <li>update SonghaySystem.com with my new <code>@songhay/player-video-you-tube</code> and <code>@songhay/index</code> 📦</li>
            <li>convert the Day Path blog to 11ty (with <code>@songhay/index</code> as a side-car app) 💪💡</li>
            <li>convert SonghaySystem.com to HTTPs by default 🔐</li>
            <li>convert Day Path Blog to HTTPs by default 🔐</li>
            <li>use the learnings from existing npm packages to build <code>@songhay/player-audio-???</code> 📦✨</li>
            <li>set up automated social-media posting with Azure logic apps (and Azure functions orchestration) ☁🤖</li>
            <li>modernize the kinté hits page into a progressive web app 💄✨</li>
