        <h3 id="getting-this-index-app-into-songhay-ng-workspace">getting this Index App into <code>songhay-ng-workspace</code></h3>
        <p>This month saw the archiving of <code>angular.io-index-app</code> [<a href="https://github.com/BryanWilhite/angular.io-index-app">GitHub</a>] because it <a href="https://github.com/BryanWilhite/songhay-ng-workspace/issues/11">is being moved</a> to <code>songhay-ng-workspace</code>. This was quite a forehead slapping moment and should be reflected in this month’s version of ‘sketching out a development schedule (revision 1)’ (below).</p>
        <h3 id="making-menudisplayitemmodel-grouping-and-sorting-framework-agnostic">making <code>MenuDisplayItemModel</code> grouping and sorting framework agnostic</h3>
        <p>Another huge slap (that apparently has been over a decade in the making), is the studio-realization that <code>MenuDisplayItemModel</code> grouping and sorting can be done in pure Typescript without regard to Angular, Vue, React, etc.</p>
        <p>I developed the <code>DisplayItemUtility</code> [<a href="https://github.com/BryanWilhite/songhay-core/blob/master/src/utilities/display-item.utility.ts">GitHub</a>] to establish what should have super obvious to me at least 10 years ago. My company name is Songhay System—not <em>systems</em>—because here we see <em>one</em> concept that can be implemented in a <em>diverse</em> array of technologies. Once the <code>DisplayItemUtility</code> shows up in C#, it will be the realization of this ideal. (The <code>DisplayItemModel</code> and <code>MenuDisplayItemModel</code>, by the way, are already here: <a href="https://github.com/BryanWilhite/SonghayCore/tree/master/SonghayCore/Models">in C#</a> and <a href="https://github.com/BryanWilhite/songhay-core/tree/master/src/models">in TypeScript</a>).</p>
        <h3 id="really-thinking-about-display-text-the-songhay-system-way">really thinking about display text the Songhay System way</h3>
        <p>Another huge cognitive step around my late arrival to this thinking party compels me <a href="https://github.com/BryanWilhite/songhay-core/issues/12">to raise the issue</a> about the limitations of having the display text concept represented by the <code>string</code>. The display text concept should start at plain text and advance through markdown—and <em>optionally</em> store HTML. This introduction of markdown as a super-fine line between plain text and HTML is a subtlety that has escaped me for at least a decade (I am just throwing decades left and right).</p>
        <p>For my sanity, I should remind myself that <code>ngx-markdown</code> did not <a href="https://github.com/jfcere/ngx-markdown/graphs/contributors">start</a> until 2017/2 but the underlying <code>marked</code> was <a href="https://github.com/markedjs/marked/graphs/contributors">around in 2011</a>.</p>
        <h3 id="sketching-out-a-development-schedule-revision-1">sketching out a development schedule (revision 1)</h3>
        <p>Today the studio development schedule looks like this:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>finish modernizing <code>@songhay/player-video-you-tube</code> and <code>@songhay/index</code> into a ready state [<a href="https://github.com/BryanWilhite/songhay-ng-workspace/issues/11">#11</a>]</li>
            <li>introduce splash page(s) to the Day Path blog (an SEO emergency—<em>for years</em>) and convert to HTTPs by default</li>
            <li>use the learnings from existing npm packages to build <code>@songhay/player-audio-???</code></li>
            <li>convert the kinté space blog to Hexo (this has been an emergency <em>for years</em>)</li>
            <li>set up automated social-media posting with Azure logic apps (and a queue of some kind?)</li>
            <li>modernize the kinté hits page into a progressive web app</li>
            <li>use the learnings of previous work to upgrade and re-release the kinté space</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The Day Path Blog bullet was moved up because many of the later bullets will not be trackable via public GitHub issues.</p>
