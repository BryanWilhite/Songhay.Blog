    <h2 id="studio-status-report-2018-08">studio status report: 2018-08</h2>
    <p>Going forward from here my passive-voice intention is to keep track of myself monthly. My work habits have always included keeping a private journal. In the “early years,” one Microsoft Word document per year was enough. As my software-development surface area grew, Microsoft OneNote became my secondary journal tool. From Microsoft OneNote, Markdown and GitHub-based cultural habits sinks in. This journal file is part my latest journal tooling.</p>

    <p>GitHub is
      <a href="https://github.com/BryanWilhite/Songhay.Dashboard/issues">tracking the progress</a> with a level detail designed to handle the possibility of short-term memory loss from a guy that is not in his twenties with lots of spare time.</p>

      <a href="https://github.com/BryanWilhite/Songhay.Dashboard/issues/7">Issue #7</a> is the first (?) public mention of the B-Roll player (its YouTube-related features) running on modern Angular. This is a studio milestone. Insert dramatic film-score music here. It looks likes the last time I mentioned this product under development was
      <a href="http://songhayblog.azurewebsites.net/blog/entry/my-autofac-packages-drama">in 2016</a>.</p>
    <h3 id="i-have-turned-off-ci-on-vsts">I have turned off CI on VSTS</h3>
    <p>After discovering that adding Node-based builds to an ASP.NET Core Solution skyrocketed to 11 minutes, I started turning off Continuous Integration (CI) on VSTS. Moreover, I finally see that
      <code>dotnet test</code> tasks can specify multiple test projects like this:</p>
    <pre class="console"><code>**/*Tests.csproj
    !**/Songhay.GenericWeb.Mvvm*/*.csproj</code></pre>
    <p>This discovery allows me to remove all of those
      <code>IgnoreAttribute</code> declarations and target more precisely.</p>
    <p>The new
      <a href="https://twitter.com/BryanWilhite/status/1024687355158884354">VSTS UI looks great</a> but it still does not allow me to see at a glance the CI state of builds.</p>

      <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIboZj-gb7Q">Triangulation 351: SmugMug and Flickr</a> features Don MacAskill, Founder of SmugMug, detailing their commitment to keep the brand and continue to develop the existing base.</p>
    <p>The studio currently depends on Flickr to archive and serve screenshots. I suspect that there is another more dedicated service that is much better suited for screenshots. The social sharing site,
      <a href="https://imgur.com/">Imgur</a>, is not that service.</p>
    <p>
      <a href="https://snag.gy/">SNAGGY</a> is closer to what I am thinking about but there is this caveat: “If you make an account, your images will be stored as long as they have been viewed at least once in the last 6 months. Pro accounts, an upcoming feature, will have unlimited storage lifetime.”</p>
    <p>The guidance in “
      <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/help/photos-videos/screenshots">Share and save screenshots with Dropbox</a>” look like it’s worth a try
      <em>but</em> my use of

    <p>What might be a great, simple,
      <em>central</em> solution to sharing screenshots involves throwing images (using the new
      <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/features/storage-explorer/">Azure Storage Explorer</a>) on a BLOB container. All legacy screenshots can be moved there.</p>
