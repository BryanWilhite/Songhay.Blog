Now the Songhay studio can steam ahead with view toward bigger business. The first step is getting this shared/reusable Javascript on <a href=\"https://www.npmjs.com/~rasx\">npm</a>!</p><p>I remember when I opened my npm account <em>years and years</em> ago seriously doubting that I would see a day like this.</p><p>Today the studio development schedule looks like this:</p><ul><li>finish modernizing <code>@songhay/player-video-you-tube</code> into a ready state</li><li>use the learnings from existing npm packages to build <code>@songhay/player-audio-???</code></li><li>convert the kinté space blog to Hexo (this has been an emergency <em>for years</em>)</li><li>set up automated social-media posting with Azure logic apps (and a queue of some kind?)</li><li>introduce splash pages to the Day Path blog (an SEO emergency—<em>for years</em>)</li><li>modernize the kinté hits page into a progressive web app</li><li>use the learnings of previous work to upgrade and re-release the kinté space</li></ul><p>I assume that this work can be completed in 2019. No more studio emergencies going on—<em>for years</em>.</p><h3 id=\"the-gihub-credentials-drama-solved\">the GiHub credentials drama solved?</h3><p>Long story short: reinstalling <a href=\"https://github.com/Microsoft/Git-Credential-Manager-for-Windows/releases/latest\">Microsoft Git Credential Manager for Windows</a> appears to have fixed the problem.</p><p>@<a href=\"https://twitter.com/bryanwilhite\">BryanWilhite</a></p>",
