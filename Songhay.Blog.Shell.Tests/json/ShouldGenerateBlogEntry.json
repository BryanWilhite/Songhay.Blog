The answer to this question (at work) looks like it’s <em>yes</em> which means <code>HttpClient.post()</code> will invoke <code>post()</code> for every subscriber. This default behavior is <em>not</em> what I would expect and the <code>shared()</code> method [<a href=\"https://github.com/ReactiveX/rxjs/blob/01a09789a0a9484c368b7bd6ed37f94d25490a00/doc/operators.md#multicasting-operators\">docs</a>] is supposed to meet my expectations. A <a href=\"https://stackblitz.com/edit/rxjs-observable-share?file=app%2Fapp.component.ts\">StackBlitz example</a> out there is not really helping me at the moment.</p><p>I have yet to release my flippant remarks on <code>BehaviorSubject</code> which is the core of the observable store service (which is kind of like the Angular answer to WPF event aggregation?). This is kind of a big deal for me as this topic addresses the bigger topic of Redux as an intermediate step towards robust, full-featured state management.</p><h3 id=\"npm-packaging-research-still-underway\">NPM packaging research still underway</h3><p><a href=\"https://github.com/BryanWilhite/nodejs/tree/master/npm-package\">Research</a> on NPM packaging and modules has led up to the need to include TypeScript in the mix.
