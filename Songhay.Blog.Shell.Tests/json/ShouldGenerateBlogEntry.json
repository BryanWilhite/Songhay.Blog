The following GitHub issues detail the transition:</p><ul><li><a href=\"https://github.com/BryanWilhite/Songhay.Dashboard/issues/53\" class=\"uri\">https://github.com/BryanWilhite/Songhay.Dashboard/issues/53</a></li><li><a href=\"https://github.com/BryanWilhite/Songhay.Dashboard/issues/54\" class=\"uri\">https://github.com/BryanWilhite/Songhay.Dashboard/issues/54</a></li><li><a href=\"https://github.com/BryanWilhite/Songhay.Dashboard/issues/55\" class=\"uri\">https://github.com/BryanWilhite/Songhay.Dashboard/issues/55</a></li><li><a href=\"https://github.com/BryanWilhite/Songhay.Dashboard/issues/59\" class=\"uri\">https://github.com/BryanWilhite/Songhay.Dashboard/issues/59</a></li></ul><h3 id=\"daz3d-studio-is-stabilized\">Daz3D Studio is stabilized</h3><p>The ultimate fix for my recent Daz3D problems was to reinstall Windows 10 (the 1903 build) which was painful and time consuming. It was important to install MSI drivers <a href=\"https://www.arduino.cc/en/Guide/DriverInstallation\">the old-fashioned way</a> (with the <strong>Browse my computer for driver software</strong> command) and not trust any default suite installs from any optical media.</p><p>The <a href=\"https://forums.tomshardware.com/threads/nahimic-audio-service.3396247/\">Nahimic service</a> (installed by MSI optical media) was found to be directly correlated to causing Daz3D studio to crash with the white view ports. This trial-and-error process with the <a href=\"https://www.howtogeek.com/school/using-windows-admin-tools-like-a-pro/lesson8/\">Services Manager</a> and <code>MSCONFIG.EXE</code> was also painful and time consuming.</p><h3 id=\"songhayindex-and-lunr-andor-bing-web-search-api\"><code>@songhay/index</code> and lunr and/or Bing Web Search API</h3><p>Converting the Day Path Blog to 11ty has some back-end implications. The 11ty pipeline will be based on markdown, eliminating JSON as the storage format. This implies that <a href=\"http://songhayblog.azurewebsites.net/blog/entry/setting-up-an-azure-search-json-blob-indexer-with-api-version-2015-02-28-preview\">Azure Search over JSON in Azure Storage</a> can no longer be used to drive Index App search.</p><p>I think the Index App should be based on <a href=\"https://lunrjs.com/\">lunr</a> and <a href=\"https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/cognitive-services/bing-web-search-api/\">Bing Web Search</a> (or some open source equivalent). This new thinking should be made coherent with the old thinking of this issue: <a href=\"https://github.com/BryanWilhite/songhay-ng-workspace/issues/13\" class=\"uri\">https://github.com/BryanWilhite/songhay-ng-workspace/issues/13</a></p><h3 id=\"sketching-out-a-development-schedule-revision-3\">sketching out a development schedule (revision 3)</h3><p>Today the studio development schedule looks like this:</p><ul><li><del>get 11ty pipelines running with the FunkyKB</del> ✔</li><li><del>migrate Thunderbird email to new Hyper-V Ubuntu VM</del> ✔</li><li><del>move the kinté space blog to an 11ty pipeline (this has been another emergency <em>for years</em>)</del> ✔</li><li><del>update SonghaySystem.com with my new <code>@songhay/player-video-you-tube</code></del> ✔</li><li>convert the Day Path blog to 11ty (with <code>@songhay/index</code> as a side-car app) 💪💡</li><li>convert SonghaySystem.com to HTTPs by default 🔐</li><li>convert Day Path Blog to HTTPs by default 🔐</li><li>use the learnings from existing npm packages to build <code>@songhay/player-audio-???</code> 📦✨</li><li>set up automated social-media posting with Azure logic apps (and Azure functions orchestration) ☁🤖</li><li>modernize the kinté hits page into a progressive web app 💄✨</li><li>use the learnings of previous work to upgrade and re-release the kinté space 🚀</li></ul><p>@<a href=\"https://twitter.com/bryanwilhite\">BryanWilhite</a></p>",
