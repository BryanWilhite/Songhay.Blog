# Songhay.Blog

[![Build Status](https://songhay.visualstudio.com/SonghaySystem/_apis/build/status/songhay-system-blog-yaml-build)](https://songhay.visualstudio.com/SonghaySystem/_build/latest?definitionId=8)

Here is the source code for [my technical Blog](http://songhayblog.azurewebsites.net/) that will replace what is currently running as of this writing.

There is a separate repository that holds [the articles of this Blog system](https://github.com/BryanWilhite/Blog), currently existing for historical reasons.

## Songhay.Blog project

The `Songhay.Blog` [project](./Songhay.Blog) was generated from the `Microsoft.DotNet.Web.Spa.ProjectTemplates::2.0.0` [templates](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/spa/index?view=aspnetcore-2.1#installation) which promise to be more in compliance with Google standards and [the Angular CLI](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/spa/angular?view=aspnetcore-2.1&tabs=visual-studio#run-ng-commands).
